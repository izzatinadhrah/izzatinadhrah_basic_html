<center><h1>A HOLIDAY I WOULD NEVER FORGET</h1></center>
<body>
<p><font color="blue"><I>During last weekend,my parents decided to take us to Cameron Highlands.In the morning,we packed our clothes and loaded them into my father's car.We hit the road at 7 a.m. in my father's Suzuki Swift.</p>
<p>The road to Cameron Highlands was crooked and my mother was a bit  lightheaded.The road was filled with fog.The scenery along the road was eye pleasing.We chit-chatted along the way.After a five hours drive,we arrived at our destination.Cameron Highland has cool mountain air.Although our country is facing haze problem now,the air there was still free from pollution.It is a form escapism from all the hustle and bustle of the city life - translating into another dimension of peace and serenity.</p>
<p>First,we visited to the bee farm.We could see bees flying freely and pollinating.We could purchased some pure honey and honey products sold there.At first,I was scared to see the bees flying freely as I thought it would sting us but soon I realised that they wouldn't sting us if we didn't disturb them.Then,we moved to our second location.</p>
<p>Our second location was the Boh Tea Plantation.The teas were planted on terraced hill slopes.We also did not miss the chance to take some screenshots there.We also saw a waterfall there.The sound of water cascading from the top of the mountain was soothing to our ears and nerves.We were mesmerised by the crystal clear water.Our warm bodies chilled when the cold mountain water caressed our body.As we were enjoying the waterfall,it started to rain and we dashed to find a spot to take shelter.</p>
<p>After the heavy downpour,we decided to stop at one of the many strawberry parks in Cameron Highlands.Before leaving the tea plantation,we made sure to buy some fresh tea.We decided to visit the Big Red Strawberry Farm.A lot of strawberries were cultivated there.Salad and lettuce plants are also planted there.We had our tea time there.We bought some strawberries and souvenirs to take back home.</p>
<p>As the sun slowly set under the horizon,we knew it was time to say goodbye to this awesome place.We had a whale of a time in Cameron Highlands and we truly enjoyed ourselves.</font></I></p>
<center><p><B>On the next day, we went out to catch some crabs and fish. We used the net that we had bought and caught a lot of fish. Then, we had our lunch and went out again on the raft. We continued to row it as far as we could. It was really a pleasure to be away from the shore. The sea was calm and we could row with ease. My cousin told me many interesting things about Morib. We then returned to the shore.</B></p></center>
